I have been using Lineage OS for a couple of days. There are some aspects of Lineage OS I really liked, for example, Profiles/Workspace, App Launcher, Customization, etc. But, it is still quite buggy. On stock Android, I was used to lock device using fingerprint sensor which I greatly missed on Lineage. I had to install app from play store which was not that good enough. Device at times froze, some apps stopped unexpectedly. 


Apart from these glitches, Lineage worked well. And yes every platform has its share of pros and cons. So, I am optimistic about the project.

## Home sweet home

I went over to XDA and found an amazing article over [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g4-plus/how-to/stock-rom-npjs25-93-14-4-march-1-t3608138). I followed those steps and was back to stock within few minutes.

{% include warning.html content="I didn't flash gpt.bin and bootloader.img as it can mess up with device's cellular system. So proceed with caution, do not attempt any step unless you are 100% sure. As always, I am not responsible for your bricked device." %}

## Final notes
Lineage OS is good but IMHO they need to find solution soon to make way into user's phone for everyday use. Meanwhile, I will wait for Android Oreo :)
