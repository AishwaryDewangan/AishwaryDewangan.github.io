<p>I am <b>Aishwary Dewangan</b>. I am backend developer working on Java, Spring Boot and its related stack. Apart from tech, I have interest in finance and design.</p>

<p>Please feel free to ask me anything by creating a <a href="https://github.com/aishwarydewngan/ama/issues/new">new issue here</a>. I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. You can ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.</p>
