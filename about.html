  <h1>Hey there! I'm Aishwary.</h1>
  <br/><br/>

  <p>I am a student and an advocate of open source technologies, and therefore, major content of this blog will revolve around open source technologies but not limited to it.</p>

  <p>Yes, I am not a web developer. That is why I forked this amazing blog from <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf">Monica</a> and made minor changes to it. Monica has <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">GitHub style AMA</a> which I really
  liked <s> and I also plan to do the same</s>.</p>

  <p>AMA is ready!</p>

  <p>Ask me anything by creating a <a href="https://github.com/aishwr/ama/issues/new">new issue here</a></p>

  <p>I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.</p>

  <p>If you have something quick and easy, you can also ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_aishwr_">Twitter</a></p>

  <p>Also, we can keep in touch via <a href="mailto:aishwary.dewangan@gmail.com">email</a>. I would be happy to listen from you.
