  <h1>Hey there! I'm Aishwary.</h1>
  <br/><br/>

  <p>I am a student and an advocate of open source technologies, and therefore, major content of this blog will revolve around open source technologies but not limited to it.</p>

  <p>Please feel free to ask me anything by creating a <a href="https://github.com/aishwr/ama/issues/new">new issue here</a>. I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. You can ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.</p>

  <p>If you have something quick and easy, you can also ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/aishwarydew">Twitter</a></p>

  <p>Also, we can keep in touch via <a href="mailto:aishwary.dewangan@gmail.com">email</a>. I would be happy to listen from you. :)</p>

  <p>PS: This blog is a fork of amazing blog by Monica. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf">here</a>.
