  <h1>Hey there! I'm Aishwary.</h1>
  <br/><br/>

  <p>I am a student and advocate of open source technologies. Therefore, major content of this blog will revolve around open source technologies but not limited to it.</p>

  <p>Since I am not a web developer, I forked this blog from <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf">Monica</a> and made 
  minor changes to it. Monica has <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">GitHub style AMA</a> which I really
  liked and I also plan to do the same. Meanwhile we can keep in touch via <a href="mailto:aishwary.dewangan@gmail.com">email</a>. I would be happy to listen from you.</p>
